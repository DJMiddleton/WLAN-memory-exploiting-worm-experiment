# WLAN-memory-exploiting-worm-experiment
WORK IN PROGRESS. I attempt to develop a worm program capable of propagating over a WLAN network by taking advantage of a memory exploit in a vulnerable program. The work is purely proof of concept for a theoretical scenario with specific network requirements for the worm to operate and as such will have no effect if in any environment other than the one set up in the experiment.
