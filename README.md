# WLAN-memory-exploiting-worm-prototype
WORK IN PROGRESS. I attempt to develop a worm program capable of propagating over a WLAN network by taking advantage of a memory exploit in a vulnerable program. The work is purely proof of concept for a theoretical scenario with specific network requirements for the worm to operate and as such will have no effect if in any environment other than the one set up in the experiment.

The network requirements for the worm to operate are as follows:
-	All machines to be using a Kali-Linux distribution (this is required as the worm makes use of the nmap and ncat tools + Kali-Linux has less stack protection compared to other linux distributions) 
-	All machines to have the target service service.c running on the same port (The worm only targets a single specified port, it can be changed manually)
-	All machines to have the target service service.c running with root privileges (this is necessary to the functioning of the worm as it makes extensive use of popen and command line arguments)
-	All machines to be operating on the same subnet of the network (although this is not necessary to the functioning of the worm, it is a limitation of the worm in that it requires further victims to be on the same subnet)


INSTRUCTIONS:

(RECOMMENDED) Create and open a test network environment in Ubuntu using multiple virtual machines connected via a NAT network with the above requirements

Compile the vulnerable program vuln_service.c on the desired port (default port 9290) and disable stacks protections with the following commands:

 $gcc -g -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -z execstack -o vuln_service vuln_service.c
 
 $sudo bash -c 'echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
 
 $sudo chown root vuln_service
 
 $sudo chgrp root vuln_service
 
 $chmod +s vuln_service
 
 
Run vuln_service as superuser

Compile and run spread.c as superuser to initiate the worm 



NOTES - all components of the worm program must be stored in the same local directory

 If Ubuntu UFW firewall is suspected of blocking the worm program, use the following commands on the port used:
	
 $sudo ufw allow 9290
	
 $sudo ufw allow out 9290
